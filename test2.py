# Explanation Text
st.text("The correlation matrix above shows the relationships between racial disparities in faculty-student composition and graduation rates for each racial group. Each row corresponds to the graduation rate for a specific racial group, and each column represents the disparity in faculty composition for that group. Positive correlations indicate that greater disparities in faculty diversity are associated with higher graduation rates, while negative correlations suggest the opposite. This matrix helps understand how faculty-student diversity disparities may influence academic success rates across different racial and ethnic groups.")
